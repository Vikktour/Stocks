# 📊 RSI (Relative Strength Index) Analysis
RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements, helping traders identify **overbought** and **oversold** conditions.

## 🔢 Formula
```
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
RS = (Average Upward Price Changes) ÷ (Average Downward Price Changes)
```
(Default period: **14 days**)

## 📈 Key RSI Levels
- **Above 70** → Overbought (⚠️ Possible price drop/reversal)
- **Below 30** → Oversold (✅ Possible price rise/reversal)
- **30-70** → Neutral zone (📊 Trend continuation)

## 🛠️ How Traders Use RSI
✅ **Overbought/Oversold Signals** → RSI > 70 (Sell), RSI < 30 (Buy)  
✅ **Divergence** → Price ↑ but RSI ↓ → Possible trend reversal  
✅ **Support & Resistance** → RSI helps confirm trend strength  

🚀 *Best used with Moving Averages, MACD, and Bollinger Bands!*
