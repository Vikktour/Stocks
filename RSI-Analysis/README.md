RSI (Relative Strength Index) Analysis is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis to measure the speed and change of price movements. 
It helps traders identify overbought and oversold conditions in a stock or asset.

How RSI Works:
Formula:
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
where RS (Relative Strength) = (Average of Upward Price Changes) ÷ (Average of Downward Price Changes) over a period (typically 14 days).

Key RSI Levels:
Above 70 → Overbought (possible price drop or reversal).
Below 30 → Oversold (possible price rise or reversal).
Between 30-70 → Neutral zone (trend continuation).

How Traders Use RSI:
Overbought/Oversold Signals → If RSI crosses above 70, traders may sell; if it drops below 30, traders may buy.
Divergence → If price moves up but RSI moves down, it may signal a trend reversal.
Support & Resistance Levels → RSI can indicate whether an asset is respecting a trend line.
